# Comparsion of Message Oriented Middleware's Java Client libraries

When it comes to using a Message-Oriented middleware there are several client libraries available depending on the message broker service you choose. This is a small comparsion between those java client libraries.

| Message Broker Service        | JMS 1.1 | JMS 2.0 | Communication Protocol | Spring Wrapper |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Rabbit MQ                     |         |         |                        |                |
| Active MQ Classic (Amazon MQ) |         |         |                        |                |
| Active MQ Artemis             |         |         |                        |                |
| Google Cloud Pub Sub          |         |         |                        |                |
